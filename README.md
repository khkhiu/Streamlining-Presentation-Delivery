## Implementation phase
1. Get chatbot to be able to 'listen' to and respond to user question
2. Allow the uploading of scripts to chatbot so it can present
3. Create a 3D presenter in Unity or similar software
4. Integrate chatbot functionality into model
5. [Optional] Superimpose KAH's faces onto 3D models
